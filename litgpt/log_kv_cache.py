"""Log-Structured KV Cache with merged-position slots — strict O(B·log N).

Architecture (uniform 2:1 compaction at every level):
- Buffer (sliding window): recent_size raw tokens, no compression (exact keys).
- Level 0 (write level):   B entries, each = 2 tokens merged. Partially fillable
                            (0 to B entries). Filled one entry at a time from buffer
                            flush. When full, carries to level 1.
- Level 1+ (carry levels):  B entries per level, each = 2 entries from prev level
                            merged. All-or-nothing (0 or B entries). Binary carry
                            promotes full blocks upward.

Position handling ("expected RoPE", merged into the compressed state):
- Keys enter the cache as FULL post-RoPE vectors
      k_j = [ R(p_j)·k_pos_j ; k_content_j ]
  (partial rotary: only the leading rope_n_elem dims are rotated; any remaining
  content channel is position-free; full rotary means the content channel is
  empty — both are supported).
- Merging a block mean-pools the WHOLE key. Mean commutes with concatenation, so
  the merged key is [ mean_j R(p_j)·k_pos_j ; mean_j k_content_j ]: the block's
  position embedding is the weighted mean of its tokens' rotated position keys —
  the exact expectation of the rotation over the span. Per RoPE frequency θ over
  a width-w span centred at c this equals R(c)·sin(wθ/2)/(w·sin(θ/2)): RoPE at
  the span centre, damped per-frequency by a Dirichlet factor. High frequencies
  fade as spans widen, so positional resolution decays ∝ span width ∝ distance
  (constant relative error). The merged key is deliberately NOT renormalized:
  the norm shrinkage encodes the span's positional uncertainty.
- Optional AlphaLogKV retains a fixed-size pool of exact spans outside recent.

Slot attention (``log_kv_slot_attention``), when rank-1 stats are supplied:
    score_s = scale·(q · k_s) + 0.5·scale²·sigma2_s·(q · sigma_u_s)² + λ·log(w_s)
    read_s  = v_s + scale·gamma_s·(q · gamma_a_s)·gamma_b_s
    out     = softmax(score) · read
The +λ·log(w_s) mass bias gives a w-token slot softmax mass ≈ w·exp(score),
while the Sigma/Gamma terms add the second-order score correction and first-order
value read-out correction. Exact recent / in-flight tokens carry zero stats, so
they reduce to ordinary token attention. Calling ``log_kv_slot_attention`` without
stats preserves the original first-order compatibility path.

Memory:  O(recent_size + B·log(N/2)) slots — no Θ(N) term.
Compute: O(recent_size + B·log(N/2)) per query — no Θ(N) term.

    Args:
        k_shape: (batch_size, n_groups, max_seq_length, k_dim) — k_dim is the
            FULL post-RoPE key width (RoPE'd position channel + content channel).
            max_seq_length only sizes the level hierarchy and the append-only
            token counter; no O(N) buffer is allocated.
        v_shape: (batch_size, n_groups, max_seq_length, v_dim)
        B: slots per level (default 512)
        recent_size: sliding window size (default 0 = 2)
        device / dtype: torch device / dtype
        importance_pooling: if True, merges are weighted by a per-token
            importance mass (tracked separately from the token-count weight
            ``w``, which keeps driving the ``log(w)`` mass bias unchanged)
            instead of a uniform mean. See ``compact()``/``_compact_tokens()``.
        importance_pooling_lambda: only consulted when ``importance_pooling``
            is True. Linearly blends the importance-driven pooling share
            toward the uniform/count-driven share — ``1.0`` (default) is pure
            importance pooling, ``0.0`` is numerically equivalent to plain
            uniform pooling, values in between interpolate. Added after the
            first decisive eval (2026-08-14) showed importance pooling
            improves ACC/LongBench but regresses niah — the working
            hypothesis is that the pure key-norm heuristic over-weights
            high-norm non-needle tokens, and a partial blend may recover
            niah while keeping most of the LongBench gain (see CLAUDE.md 6.5).
        importance_pooling_temperature: only consulted when
            ``importance_pooling`` is True. Exponent applied to the raw
            per-token importance heuristic (key L2 norm) before it is
            normalized into pooling weights: ``imp = raw_imp ** temperature``.
            ``1.0`` (default) is the original heuristic, unchanged (bit-
            identical short-circuit). Values ``< 1.0`` compress the dynamic
            range, damping outlier tokens (e.g. attention-sink-style high-
            norm tokens) relative to the bulk, without fully discarding the
            salience signal the way blending the whole distribution toward
            uniform (``importance_pooling_lambda``) does; ``temperature -> 0``
            approaches uniform in the limit, ``> 1.0`` sharpens further.
            Orthogonal to ``importance_pooling_lambda`` — both may be set at
            once (temperature reshapes first, lambda blends the result).

        regimes, silently.

        - True -> False mid-stream: the next binary carry takes the no-stats
          branch of ``compact()``, which ignores whatever stats the existing
          level already had and produces a merged entry with none — those
          real, previously-built stats are gone.
        - False -> True mid-stream: the next carry merges genuine new stats
          against a sibling that has structural zero stats (built while this
          was False) via Chan's formula. That reads as "this half of the slot
          had exactly zero variance", not "unknown" — an understated, wrong
          covariance for the merged slot, not a conservative one.

        Both keep producing finite numbers, so nothing downstream would flag
        it. Call ``reset_parameters()`` before switching regimes on a cache

        Mean-pooling the full key merges content and position in one step:
        the position sub-channel becomes the expected rotation over the span
        (see module docstring). No renormalization — the per-frequency norm
        shrinkage encodes the span's positional uncertainty.
        Returns k_entry (B,G,1,k_dim), v_entry (B,G,1,v_dim), w_entry (B,G,1).
        With ``with_stats=True`` also returns rank-1 approximations to the
        within-slot key covariance and value-key cross covariance.

        ``imp``, when given, replaces the uniform 1/n pooling weight with a
        per-token importance-weighted mean (need not be pre-normalized); the

        Concatenates the two blocks in time order (k1=older, k2=newer) and pairs
        ADJACENT slots: (slot 2i, slot 2i+1) -> slot i. Every merged slot covers
        a contiguous span, and the weighted mean keeps each slot's key equal to
        the true weighted mean over all tokens it covers (mean-merge is
        associative), so no error accumulates across levels.

        If the rank-1 stats are provided for both input blocks, they are merged
        with Chan's parallel covariance formula and truncated back to rank 1 via
        the iterative small-matrix routines above (near-optimal, not exact — see
        their docstrings). Without stats, this preserves the old three-tensor
        return for tests and diagnostic callers.

        ``imp1``/``imp2`` are optional per-slot importance-mass tensors (same
        shape as ``w1``/``w2``), independent of the token-count weights: when
        given, they (not ``w1``/``w2``) drive the pooling ``alpha`` and the
        Chan-merge fractions, and their sum is returned as one extra trailing
        tensor. ``w_total`` (token count, used only for the ``log(w)`` mass
        bias) is always computed from ``w1``/``w2`` regardless. Omitting them
        reproduces the exact prior count-weighted behavior and return shape.
        ``imp_lambda`` (only consulted when ``imp1``/``imp2`` are given) linearly
        blends the importance share toward the count share ``wa/w_total`` —
        ``1.0`` (default) is pure importance (unchanged expression, bit-identical
        to the pre-``imp_lambda`` code), ``0.0`` is numerically equivalent to the
        count-weighted path.

        ``p_lo*``/``p_hi*``/``sum_wp*`` are optional per-slot semantic-cluster
        anchor fields (see ``log_kv_position.merge_anchors``); when given for
        both inputs, the merged ``(p_lo, p_hi, sum_wp)`` is appended as a
        trailing 3-tuple, independent of the ``imp``/rank-1-stats branches.
        Omitting them reproduces the exact prior return shape.

        out     = softmax(score) · read

    One logit per SLOT — compute and memory are O(S) = O(recent + B·log N),
    never O(N). The position information lives inside ``slot_k`` (expected-RoPE
    sub-channel, see module docstring), so a single dot product covers both the
    content and the position score. The +λ·log(w_s) bias restores the softmax
    mass a w-token span would have contributed token-by-token; it is exact when
    the span's tokens are identical and first-order otherwise. When the optional
    rank-1 stats are present, the Sigma/Gamma terms add the cheap second-order
    slot corrections. λ=1 preserves mass ∝ token count; λ=0 yields a built-in
    ∝1/w long-range forgetting curve (ablation knob).

    Note the bias is added AFTER ``scale``: it is a multiplicity correction on
    the logits, not a similarity, so it must not be shrunk by 1/sqrt(d).

    Preconditions (enforced by construction in the callers):
      - ``slot_w`` entries are >= 1 (log is finite);
      - every ``mask`` row has at least one True (softmax row is finite) —
        chunk-causal masks always allow the diagonal;
      - if ``slot_valid`` is given, every row must keep >= 1 valid slot after
        all masking — checked at runtime (raises) since this one isn't
        guaranteed by construction the way ``mask``/``causal_tail`` are.

    Args:
        q: (B, nh, T_q, k_dim)
        slot_k / slot_v / slot_w: from ``get_attention_state()`` (+ optionally
            ``append_exact_tokens`` for the in-flight chunk)
        slot_sigma_u / slot_sigma2 / slot_gamma_a / slot_gamma_b / slot_gamma:
            optional rank-1 second-order slot statistics. When present, score
            receives ``0.5 * scale**2 * sigma2 * (q·sigma_u)**2`` and value
            read-out receives ``scale * gamma * (q·gamma_a) * gamma_b``. Both
            corrections are multiplied by ``second_order_scale`` as a single
            coupled gate, so CPT can warm them up together.
        scale: attention scale (applied to the dot product only)
        mask: optional (T_q, S) bool. True = allowed. General-purpose escape
            hatch (tests); the model uses ``causal_tail`` instead. None (and
            causal_tail == 0) = attend all.
        lam: weight of the log-multiplicity mass bias (default 1.0)
        slot_M: distinct-anchor count per slot (see ``log_kv_position.
            dedup_anchors``). When given, the mass bias becomes
            ``lam*log(w) - log(M)`` (the ``-log(M)`` term is unconditional,
            not gated by ``lam``) so anchor-expanded entries don't leak
            ``M``-fold extra softmax mass. None reproduces the exact prior
            ``lam*log(w)`` formula.
        slot_valid: (B, G, S_pooled) bool, True = real anchor. Covers only
            the pooled-entry prefix of the slot axis (S_pooled <= S); the
            exact/in-flight suffix is never invalid by construction. Masked
            slots get score -inf, same as ``mask``/``causal_tail`` but
            orthogonal to both (can combine with either).
        causal_tail: if > 0, the LAST ``causal_tail`` slots are the in-flight
            chunk appended behind the frozen cache state (see
            ``append_exact_tokens``); they are masked causally against the
            queries (query i sees appended entry j iff j <= i; requires
            ``causal_tail == T_q``), while everything before them stays fully
            visible. Memory: this replaces a (T_q, S) bool mask + a
            masked_fill copy of the full fp32 score tensor with one in-place
            fill on the (T_q, causal_tail) tail slice — per streaming chunk,

    """Constant-in-T-times-S memory autograd for logKV streaming training.

    Problem: the naive training graph saves, for every 2-token chunk, the
    concatenated [detached prefix + chunk] keys/values (O(S) each) that its
    two matmuls need for backward. Per layer that is O(T/2 * S) saved tensors
    — hundreds of GB for a 32K stream at B=512/recent=1024 — the long-context
    training OOM (the failing allocation is merely whichever op runs next
    once the accumulated graph has eaten the device).

    Forward here streams the whole sequence with NO recorded graph and returns
    the attention output. Backward resets the cache and REPLAYS the same stream:
    each block's attention is recomputed with a throwaway local graph that
    ``torch.autograd.grad`` consumes immediately, so at most one block graph is
    alive at any time. Peak memory: O(T + train_block*S) instead of O(T*S).
    Semantic replay additionally saves O(T/train_block*S) compact integer/bool
    anchor metadata, avoiding repeated sorting and device-to-host counts. It
    releases plans after backward. Update replay additionally retains detached
    write payloads and state until this graph's backward completes.
    When a Block checkpoint has LogKV routing contexts installed, its recompute
    reuses the original op-log instead of calculating routing decisions again.
    Both replay passes share CPU-only parsed schedules owned by this graph;
    neither old K/V nor device addresses are retained in these schedules.
    Cost: one extra streaming pass plus the per-block backwards.

    Correctness:
      - For a fixed train_block, gradients are EXACT for that block-streaming
        objective: in the naive graph, gradient reaches q/k/v only through each
        token's own block (the cache commits detached copies), so per-block
        grads are complete and disjoint, and the replayed per-block
        ``autograd.grad`` reproduces them one-to-one.
      - Routing and exact-span choices are recorded. Beta also records its
        content-dependent compaction cuts; replay applies these same weighted
        merges without reselecting, rebuilding the forward prefix states.
      - Backward does not depend on any cache state forward left behind: it
        resets the buffers AND re-derives ``cache.second_order`` from its own
        ``second_order_scale`` before replaying, so neither interleaved
        forward/backward across micro-batches, nor activation-checkpoint
        recompute ordering, nor another layer running at a different gate can
        make the replay rebuild a cache that forward never attended over.

    ``train_block=2`` is the strict 2-token streaming reference. Larger blocks
    freeze the prefix state at block start and use causal exact attention within
    the block, matching the inference prefill speed/memory tradeoff while
    preserving the exact final cache state. First-order autograd only
    (``once_differentiable``) — CPT never needs grad-of-grad.
