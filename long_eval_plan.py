"""The passes of a long-context evaluation over several lengths (eval.sh with eval_lengths / EVAL_LENGTHS).

The model and its CPT only reach 32K; longer contexts take YaRN (factor = length / 32768, original length 32768,
beta_fast 32, beta_slow 1, as Qwen's rope_scaling). Every length gets its own pass: a model window of the length
plus a 1024-token margin for generation, RULER at that length, and that length's tasks. The window is also
LongBench v2's context budget, so each pass's LongBench v2 is cut to its length.

YARN_MODE picks the factor:
- per_length (default): each pass the factor its length needs (32K none, 64K 2, 128K 4, 256K 8, 512K 16, 1M 32), so 32K matches
  the 32K main line and every length compares compression, not extrapolation.
- fixed: every pass the factor of the longest length asked for, the model as deployed for that length (static
  YaRN, as vLLM serves it); shorter lengths then show what that setting costs them.
YaRN's frequencies and temperature depend on the factor alone, not on the window, so a fixed pass at 32K differs
from a per_length one only in the factor.

EVAL_SUITES chooses the tasks (default all): ruler (NIAH stage: all of RULER, 12 tasks at 256K without
ruler_qa_squad, whose 1204 SQuAD paragraphs cannot fill it), babilong, ppl (long_ppl_<L>, LONG_PPL_DATA), books
(long_ppl_books_<L>, LONG_PPL_BOOKS), turns (niah_turns_<L>), longbench2 (longbench2_<L>) and infinitebench
(infinitebench_<L>; INFINITEBENCH_DIR, <HF_HOME>/infinitebench or the hub cache). NIAH_ONLY=1 keeps ruler only. With
the default suites ppl, books and infinitebench are optional: eval.py leaves them out, with the reason, when
their data is not given (or their files are not whole). LongBench v2 must run at every selected length;
missing or incomplete data is an error with a download command. Named suites must run.
512K/1M are opt-in. Their default task list omits InfiniteBench (registered through 256K); asking explicitly
for InfiniteBench at these lengths is an error. RULER uses the documented extended-v1 generator protocol.

    python long_eval_plan.py <lengths> <suites or ""> <yarn_mode> <niah_only 0/1> <base overrides json or ""> <output dir> [skip]

skip lists what an earlier stage of the same job already measured (majob.sh's main line, eval.sh's full
evaluation): a main task by name, a RULER task at a length as task@length (e.g. niah_single_1@32768); a pass left
with nothing to run is dropped. "python long_eval_plan.py measured <main tasks> <NIAH tasks> <lengths json>" prints
that list for a main line.

prints one line per pass, fields separated by "|": output dir, config overrides (json), RULER lengths (json),
main tasks, NIAH tasks (comma lists, or none), optional tasks.
